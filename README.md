# PyFinDash

Python Financial Dashboard to keep track of personal investments, expenses and essentials

## MVP

This app will be dockerized and will have a backend in Python and the frontend will be in React

Probably will include an docker for DB as well but right now mostly everything will be from free APIs which can be Yahoo finance, Moneycontrol, Screener.in, NSE etc sources
